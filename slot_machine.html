        <h1 class="welcome-text">Welcome to the Computer Programming Slot Machine!</h1>
        <p>The slot machine is a work in progress and we need YOUR help to make sure it's in order so we've gifted you $10(1000 credits) to use on the computer programming-themed slot machine below! The rules are simple. Select a button for how much you'd like to insert into the machine. Be careful, it will spin as soon as you press one so pick wisely. It doesn't increase your chances to pick a higher number but it does increase your payout. You can continue to click based on how much you'd like to put in or you can just click the handle to spin the reels.</p>
